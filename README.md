# Convoy [![Build Status](https://drone8.rancher.io/api/badges/rancher/convoy/status.svg)](https://drone8.rancher.io/rancher/convoy)

## Overview
Convoy is a Docker volume plugin for a variety of storage back-ends. It supports vendor-specific extensions like snapshots, backups, and restores. It's written in Go and can be deployed as a standalone binary.

[![Convoy_DEMO](https://asciinema.org/a/9y5nbp3h97vyyxnzuax9f568e.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/9y5nbp3h97vyyxnzuax9f568e?autoplay=1&loop=1&size=medium&speed=2)

## Why use Convoy?
Convoy makes it easy to manage your data in Docker.
It provides persistent volumes for Docker containers with support for snapshots, backups, and restores on various back-ends (e.g. device mapper, NFS, EBS).

For example, you can:

* Migrate volumes between hosts
* Share the same volumes across hosts
* Schedule periodic snapshots of volumes
* Recover a volume from a previous backup

### Supported back-ends
* Device Mapper
* Virtual File System (VFS) / Network File System (NFS)
* Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

## Quick Start Guide
First, make sure Docker 1.8 or above is running.
```bash
docker --version
```
If not, install the latest Docker daemon as follows:
```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```
Once the right Docker daemon version is running, install and configure the Convoy volume plugin as follows:
```bash
wget https://github.com/rancher/convoy/releases/download/v0.5.1/convoy.tar.gz
tar xvzf convoy.tar.gz
sudo cp convoy/convoy convoy/convoy-pdata_tools /usr/local/bin/
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/plugins/
sudo bash -c 'echo "unix:///var/run/convoy/convoy.sock" > /etc/docker/plugins/convoy.spec'
```
You can use a file-backed loopback device to test and demo Convoy Device Mapper driver. A loopback device, however, is known to be unstable and should _**not**_ be used in production.
```bash
truncate -s 100G data.vol
truncate -s 1G metadata.vol
sudo losetup /dev/loop5 data.vol
sudo losetup /dev/loop6 metadata.vol
```
Once the data and metadata devices are set up, you can start the Convoy plugin daemon as follows:
```bash
sudo convoy daemon --drivers devicemapper --driver-opts dm.datadev=/dev/loop5 --driver-opts dm.metadatadev=/dev/loop6
```
You can create a Docker container with a convoy volume. As a test, create a file called `/vol1/foo` in the Convoy volume:
```bash
sudo docker run -v vol1:/vol1 --volume-driver=convoy ubuntu touch /vol1/foo
```
Next, take a snapshot of the convoy volume and backup the snapshot to a local directory: (You can also [make backups to an NFS share or S3 object store](#backup-a-snapshot).)
```bash
sudo convoy snapshot create vol1 --name snap1vol1
sudo mkdir -p /opt/convoy/
sudo convoy backup create snap1vol1 --dest vfs:///opt/convoy/
```
The `convoy backup` command returns a URL string representing the backup dataset. You can use this URL to recover the volume on another host:
```bash
sudo convoy create res1 --backup <backup_url>
```
The following command creates a new container and mounts the recovered Convoy volume into that container:
```bash
sudo docker run -v res1:/res1 --volume-driver=convoy ubuntu ls /res1/foo
```
You should see the recovered file in `/res1/foo`.

## Installation
Ensure you have Docker 1.8 or above installed.

Download the latest version of [Convoy][version] and unzip it. Put the binaries in a directory in the execution `$PATH` of sudo and root users (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

[version]: https://github.com/rancher/convoy/releases/download/v0.5.1/convoy.tar.gz

```bash
wget https://github.com/rancher/convoy/releases/download/v0.5.1/convoy.tar.gz
tar xvzf convoy.tar.gz
sudo cp convoy/convoy convoy/convoy-pdata_tools /usr/local/bin/
```
Run the following commands to set up the Convoy volume plugin for Docker:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/plugins/
sudo bash -c 'echo "unix:///var/run/convoy/convoy.sock" > /etc/docker/plugins/convoy.spec'
```

## Start Convoy Daemon

You need to pass different arguments to the Convoy daemon depending on your choice of back-end implementation.

#### Device Mapper
If you're running in a production environment with the Device Mapper driver, it's recommended to attach a new, empty block device to the host Convoy is running on.
Then you can make two partitions on the device using [`dm_dev_partition.sh`][dm_script] to get two block devices ready for the Device Mapper driver. See [Device Mapper Partition Helper][helper] for more details.

[dm_script]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/convoy/master/tools/dm_dev_partition.sh
[helper]: https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/devicemapper.md#device-mapper-partition-helper

Device Mapper requires two block devices to create storage pool for all volumes and snapshots. Assuming you have two devices created one data device called `/dev/convoy-vg/data` and the other metadata device called `/dev/convoy-vg/metadata`, then run the following command to start the Convoy daemon:
```bash
sudo convoy daemon --drivers devicemapper --driver-opts dm.datadev=/dev/convoy-vg/data --driver-opts dm.metadatadev=/dev/convoy-vg/metadata
```
* The default Device Mapper volume size is 100G. You can override it with the `---driver-opts dm.defaultvolumesize` option.
* You can take a look [here](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/devicemapper.md#calculate-the-size-you-need-for-metadata-block-device) if you want to know how much storage should be allocated for the metadata device.

#### NFS
First, mount the NFS share to the root directory used to store volumes. Substitute `<vfs_path>` with the appropriate directory of your choice:
```bash
sudo mkdir <vfs_path>
sudo mount -t nfs <nfs_server>:/path <vfs_path>
```
The NFS-based Convoy daemon can be started as follows:
```bash
sudo convoy daemon --drivers vfs --driver-opts vfs.path=<vfs_path>
```

#### EBS
Make sure you're running on an EC2 instance and have already [configured AWS credentials](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go#configuring-credentials) correctly.
```bash
sudo convoy daemon --drivers ebs
```

#### DigitalOcean
Make sure you're running on a DigitalOcean Droplet and that you have the `DO_TOKEN` environment variable set with your key.
```bash
sudo convoy daemon --drivers digitalocean
```

## Volume Commands
#### Create a Volume

Volumes can be created using the `convoy create` command:
```bash
sudo convoy create volume_name
```
* Device Mapper: Default volume size is 100G. `--size` [option](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/devicemapper.md#create) is supported.
* EBS: Default volume size is 4G. `--size` and [some other options](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/ebs.md#create) are supported.

You can also create a volume using the [`docker run`](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/docker.md#create-container) command. If the volume does not yet exist, a new volume will be created. Otherwise the existing volume will be used.
```bash
sudo docker run -it -v test_volume:/test --volume-driver=convoy ubuntu
```

#### Delete a Volume
```bash
sudo convoy delete <volume_name>
```
or
```bash
sudo docker rm -v <container_name>
```
* NFS, EBS and DigitalOcean: The `-r/--reference` option instructs the `convoy delete` command to only delete the reference to the volume from the current host and leave the underlying files on [NFS server](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/vfs.md#delete) or [EBS volume](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/ebs.md#delete) unchanged. This is useful when the volume need to be reused later.
* [`docker rm -v`](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/docker.md#delete-container) would be treated as `convoy delete` with `-r/--reference`.
* If you use `--rm` with `docker run`, all Docker volumes associated with the container would be deleted on container exit with `convoy delete --reference`. See [Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for details.

#### List and Inspect a Volume
```bash
sudo convoy list
sudo convoy inspect vol1
```

#### Take Snapshot of a Volume
```bash
sudo convoy snapshot create vol1 --name snap1vol1
```

#### Delete a Snapshot
```bash
sudo convoy snapshot delete snap1vol1
```
* Device Mapper: please make sure you keep [the latest backed-up snapshot](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/devicemapper.md#backup-create) for the same volume available to enable the incremental backup mechanism. Convoy needs it to calculate the differences between snapshots.

#### Backup a Snapshot
* Device Mapper or VFS: You can backup a snapshot to an NFS mount/local directory or an S3 object store:
```bash
sudo convoy backup create snap1vol1 --dest vfs:///opt/backup/
```
or
```bash
sudo convoy backup create snap1vol1 --dest s3://backup-bucket@us-west-2/
```
or if you want to use a custom S3 endpoint (like [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio))
```bash
sudo convoy backup --s3-endpoint http://s3.example.com:9000/ create snap1vol1 --dest s3://backup-bucket@us-west-2/
```

The backup operation returns a URL string that uniquely identifies the backup dataset.
```
s3://backup-bucket@us-west-2/?backup=f98f9ea1-dd6e-4490-8212-6d50df1982ea\u0026volume=e0d386c5-6a24-446c-8111-1077d10356b0
```
If you're using S3, please make sure you have AWS credentials ready either in `~/.aws/credentials` or as environment variables, as described [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go#configuring-credentials). You may need to put credentials in `/root/.aws/credentials` or set up sudo environment variables in order to get S3 credentials to work.

* EBS: `--dest` is [not needed](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/ebs.md#backup-create). Just do `convoy backup create snap1vol1`.

#### Restore a Volume from Backup
```bash
sudo convoy create res1 --backup <url>
```
* EBS: Current host must be in the [same region](https://github.com/rancher/convoy/blob/master/docs/ebs.md#create) of the backup to be restored.

#### Mount a Restored Volume into a Docker Container
You can use the standard `docker run` command to mount the restored volume into a Docker container:
```bash
sudo docker run -it -v res1:/res1 --volume-driver convoy ubuntu
```

#### Mount an NFS-Backed Volume on Multiple Servers
You can mount an NFS-backed volume on multiple servers. You can use the standard `docker run` command to mount an existing NFS-backed mount into a Docker container. For example, if you have already created an NFS-based volume `vol1` on one host, you can run the following command to mount the existing `vol1` volume into a new container:
```bash
sudo docker run -it -v vol1:/vol1 --volume-driver=convoy ubuntu
```
